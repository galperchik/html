	<h2><center>THE SECRETS</center></h2><br>
		<p>Do you know how to increase your happiness?</p> 
		<p>While major part of the population declares herself as 'fairly happy', most of the people is also looking to feel happier than they already are [3].</p>  
		<p>While countries all over the world evolves and enjoys economic growth, happiness measures of the population indicate a general decline.</p>   
	<h2>What is Happiness?</h2>
		<p>While one tries to obtain happiness, he may find it vague and somewhat enigmatic. This characteristic maintains it as an elusive target.</br>
		Many songs have been wreaten uo on the elusiveness and anigmaticness of happiness. <a href="https://www.noamhorev.com/" target="_blank">'טיוטה של אושר'</a> by the talented Israeli writer Noam Horev is one of my favourites. 
		In order to acheive something we need first to better understend what it is that we are looking for.</p>
		<p>Happiness is a concept that expresses a positive emotional state.</br>
		It has identified emotional component and cognitive components [1,2].</br></p></div><hr>
	<h3>Emotional Happiness</h3> 
		<p>The emotional component of happiness is a greater amount of positive feelings and lesser amount of negative ones [1,2].</br> 
		Trying to avoid or minimalize the negative feelings will only draw focus to them and paradoxically, will keep us farther from happiness.</br>
		It is the positive we need to enhance and negative we need to accept and leave in peace with.</br> 
		In order to maintain long term and sustainable happiness, we should rebalance our feeling accordingly whenever new occurrences in our lives breaks it.<br></p><hr>
	<h3>Cognitive Happiness</h3>	
		<p>The cognitive happiness is the ensemble of our perceptions, cognitions and orientations that are happiness related. Therefore, it is also transformable. <br> 
		The main cognitive happiness component acknowledged is our life satisfaction [1,2].<br></p> 
		<p>Happiness Orientation - a recent research I have conducted shows that both meaning orientation and pleasure orientation for achieving happiness is simultaneously necessary for achieving full and long lasted happiness, by approaching both the emotional and cognitive components of happiness.<br></p><hr>  
	<h3>The Quest for Happiness</h3>
		<p>The pursuit of happiness is implemented in us from the rise of humankind [4]. In the early 70s, it has been recognizes as a basic human entitlement, anchored in the United States declaration of independence.<br>
		Happiness has been concidered to be the motive for all human behaviors.<br>
		The mistake that is often made is that people pursuit happiness as a good or positive feeling.<br>
		Happiness, though, is more complexed then it's emotional component solely[4].<br>
		This is the reason thing like winning the lottery, over nigh success, using drugs and even achieving goals that are not future oriented, has very limited and temporary effect on our happiness. When this effect fades out, people may feel lost and faithless.<br>  
		The form in whitch happiness is created manifests itself in the overall value and properties.
		As hall and comprehensive of it's components we form it - the more sustainable it will be.<br></p><hr>
